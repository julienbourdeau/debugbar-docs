For now, this section is very simple and shows information that are already available elsewhere. But it's a good place to add more information in the future.

[Please let me know](https://github.com/julienbourdeau/debugbar/discussions/categories/ideas) what else you would like to see here.

Open this section by clicking on the details **left of the select box**.

{!! $page->screenshot('request', "Screenshot of request details in the debugbar") !!}

The headers are collapsed for clarity, but you can expand them.

There are a few things you can configure in the Debugbar. The configuration happens in two places:

* in `config/initializers/debugbar.rb` for the general gem configuration
* in a `script` tag in your page for some specific configuration

### Ensure ruby configuration is only loaded in developement

Because the debugbar should be loaded in other environments, you should ensure the configuration is only loaded in development.
One solution is to put the configuration directly in `config/environments/development.rb`, underneath the `Rails.application.configure do` block.

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
end

Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = false
end
```

If you prefer to have a dedicated initializer, you can wrap the configuration in a `if Rails.env.development?` block or make sure the code is only executed if Debugbar is defined.

```ruby
return unless defined? Debugbar

Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = true
end
```
## Enable/disable the Debugbar

You can enable/disable the Debugbar by setting the `enabled` option in the initializer:

```ruby
Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = false # or ENV['DEBUGBAR_ENABLED'] == 'true' for example
end
```

## Ignoring requests

Once the debugbar is enabled, every request will be monitored and the debugbar will be displayed. You can ignore some requests by setting the `ignore_request` option in the initializer. This is typically useful to ignore some requests that are not relevant to you.

By default, the debugbar will ignore all requests starting with `/assets` or `/_debugbar`.

```ruby
Debugbar.configure do |config|
  # Ignore all requests starting with /admin
  config.ignore_request = -> (env) { env['PATH_INFO'].start_with? '/admin' }

  # Only log request to the API
  config.ignore_request = -> (env) { not env['PATH_INFO'].start_with? '/api/v1' }

  # Ignore requests to admin, assets and debugbar
  config.ignore_request = -> (env) do
    [Debugbar.config.prefix, "/assets", "/admin"].any? do |pfx|
      env['PATH_INFO'].start_with? pfx
    end
  end
end
```

## Using a different buffer

Whenever a request is made to the backend, the debugbar will store the data in a buffer. By default, the buffer is an in-memory buffer. You can use a different buffer by setting the `buffer_adapter` option in the initializer. So far, there is only a memory buffer and a `null` buffer.

A persisted buffer is coming to support Puma in cluster mode. Custom adapters will also be available.

```ruby
Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.buffer_adapter = :memory  # Use a memory buffer
  config.buffer_adapter = :null    # Use a null buffer
end
```

## Enable/disable a feature

This is showed in the features] section, but generally, you can enable/disable a feature in the initializer.
By default, all features are enabled if the underlying module is available. For example, Active Record is enabled if the `ActiveRecord` module is available.

```ruby
Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.active_record = false
  config.cache = true
end
```

## Changing URL and port

By default, the frontend will connect to localhost:3000. If you use another port or a domain, you need to pass the URL to the frontend.
If you use http polling, [checkout this page](/docs/polling-mode).

With the ERB helper, you can pass a hash to override [any configuration defined here](https://github.com/julienbourdeau/debugbar/blob/166e5def8/client/src/models/Config.ts#L3-L15).

```erb
<%= debugbar_body  cable: {url: "ws://something.test:3030"} %>
```

If you don't use the helper, you must define a `_debugbarConfigOptions` object. 

```js
window._debugbarConfigOptions = {
    cable: {
      url: 'ws://something.test:3030'
    },
}
```

### Using SSL

The configuration requires you to pass the entire URL so if you use SSL locally, so you can to use `wss` instead of `ws`. Us

```erb
<%= debugbar_body  cable: {url: "wss://localhost:3000"} %>
```

```js
window._debugbarConfigOptions = {
    cable: {
      url: 'wss://localhost:3000'
    },
}
```

## Using another prefix

All endpoints added by the debugbar are prefixed with `/_debugbar`.
It's unlikely that you'll need to change the prefix, but if you do, you can set the `prefix` option in the initializer.

If you change it, it also needs to be changed in the frontend configuration

```ruby
Debugbar.configure do |config|
  config.prefix = '/custom-prefix'
end
```

```erb
<%= debugbar_body  prefix: "/custom-prefix" %>
```

## Debugbar appearance

### Custom default height

If you're working on a fairly big screen, you can configure the default height of the debugbar when it opens.
Pass a value in pixel.

```erb
<%= debugbar_body height: 800 %>
```

### Minimized by default

If you prefer, the debugbar can load minimized by default, so you just see the little ruby logo at the bottom left of the screen.

```erb
<%= debugbar_body minimized: true %>
```

## Frontend configuration without the helper

If you are [not using the ERB view helper](https://debugbar.dev/docs/installation/) to render the debugbar 
(typically because you have an SPA and the shell isn't rendered by Rails), there are some configuration that will might be missing.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" data-turbo-permanent>
  window._debugbarConfigOptions = {
    activeRecord: {
      adapter: "pgsql",
    },
  }
</script>
```
